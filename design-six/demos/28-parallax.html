                    <p>The Empire State Building was completed in 1931, in the midst of the Great Depression. Upon completion, it became the tallest building in NY, surpassing the recently completed Chrysler Building, which had held the title for less than a year. Because of the ongoing Depression and the building's distance from public transportation, the Empire State Building had difficulty finding tenants, and for many years it was derisively referred to as the "Empty State Building." In fact, tenants were so few that in its first year of operation, the Empire State Building Observatory made as much money ($2 million) as the building's owners made in rent. It wasn't until the early 1950s, when the building was sold to Roger L. Stevens and his business partners, that the building began to be profitable.</p>

Over time, the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial sector (even if financial firms are not physically located there), or signifying New York-based financial interests.</p>
