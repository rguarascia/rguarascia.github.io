						Many folks swear by their cappuccino as a kind of morning savior, but did you know the drink's name has supposedly a blessed history? Today, we'll look into how the most sacred of coffee drinks came to have such an evocative appellation.

						In Italian, cappuccino literally means "little cap," which perfectly describes the luscious head of foamed milk that sits atop the drink's espresso base.

						It also allegedly derives from a religious sartorial inspiration: With their iconic brown hooded cowls and shaved heads, the monks of Capuchin are a pretty close human resemblance to the ring of crema and white foam that tops the classic beverage. An offshoot of the Franciscan Catholic order, these friars struck out on their own in 1520, adopting the coffee-colored cloak, or cappuccio, as an imitative sign of gratitude to the Benedictine Camaldolese monks, who offered Capuchins refuge while they dodged persecution from church officials.

						When expertly poured so that a circle of white is perfectly encircled by the darker coffee, the design on a "traditional" cappuccino is called a monk's head.

						(Some reputable sources insist the name strikes further back in the annals of pre-espresso history, however, and originates instead from a popular 19th-century Viennese coffee-and-frothed-milk drink called a Kapuziner, the German equivalent of "Capuchin." I say potato, you say patata—and in Vienna, they say Kartoffel.)

						Wherever the monk-y moniker originated, what we consider the modern cappuccino—an espresso-based drink topped with steamed foamed milk—didn't appear until about two decades into the 20th century, when espresso-machine manufacturers started adding steam wands to their equipment, allowing baristas to heat and texturize milk as a complement to the concentrated coffee. (Earlier versions of the gadgets featured valves the barista could use to release short bursts of steam pressure for safety's sake, but heating milk with the volatile vapor hadn't entered the equation yet.)

						Curious visitors can drop in on the bygone Italian brothers at their Roman catacombs, in a cavern underneath Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini. There, more than 4,000 clergymen's bones are on rather morbidly beautiful display, thanks to a liturgical law that prohibited underground burial on friary property. (No coffee to be had on premises of course, but in Rome you can't walk five feet without coming across a cafe.)

						Next time you thank heavens for your cappuccino, just think—somebody up there might actually be listening. </p>

						The combination of two luscious liquids, milk and espresso, work together to make a most harmonious drink whether served hot or cold.  Take a look at how this creation has become one of the most popular beverages throughout the world.

Did you ever think about who first created that precious beverage you’re holding?  Perhaps you haven’t stopped to think about how precious it really is!  Coffee has come a long way from its origins of transport from the warm tropical climates in which the beans grow.  From the first taste testers of Africa and South America coffee traveled trade routes across Europe and Asia.  Coffee as a beverage gained popularity quickly as one of the first “energy” drinks.  This lead to much debate in religious circles, and coffee was nearly banned in many areas.  However, this now common and widespread drink could not be stopped.  It is as popular today for its many qualities as it was hundreds of years ago.


The number one most distinguishable aspect to coffee is it’s taste.  Delicious to drink, there is no end to the many ways it is prepared and served throughout the world.  One of the most popular forms of coffee is Espresso. A denser, stronger tasting liquid derived from coffee beans, espresso is often consumed as is with out adding so much as a grain of sugar.  Yet in regions where dairy was plentiful, people began to experiment with their favorite hot drink.  The word “latte” comes from the Italian word for milk, and it is often held that Italy popularized the addition of hot milk to espresso.



Not too many years ago, ordering a “latte” might mean getting only a glass of milk! “Caffelatte” is the appropriate Italian term for the blending of steaming milk with espresso.   And to order a latte in Spanish speaking coffeehouses, be sure to request a “café con leche”.  In more recent years, North Americans have shortened the name of this drink to just “latte”.



These days a latte is considered one of the smoothest blends of two delicious beverages that can be manipulated to fit any taste.  Lattes are served with ice on hot days for a year-round treat.  Those who have lactose intolerance can easily substitute soy or rice milk instead of the bovine product for the same great taste. Flavored lattes are all the rage, where syrups and spices can accent a latte to suit any occasion, season or holiday.  In Asian cultures, powdered tea with milk is considered a latte that is also of the most scrumptious variation.



Among the other diverse ways coffee and milk are prepared include a cappuccino or a flat white.  These unique drinks vary in creation from a latte due to varying amounts of foam and steamed milk added to espresso.  As we can see, the brilliant combination has elevated a regular cup of joe to an exquisite drink to be enjoyed everywhere.  So tip your hat and say, “Thanks a latte!”

						<h2>Caffe Mocha</h2>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="cd-project-info">

						The fact is that the word mocha did not originally have have anything to do with chocolate or a combination of chocolate and coffee. The term actually originated as early as 1773 and referred to a variety of coffee. In the late 1700's, one variety of coffee beans became extremely popular in Europe, and these are still among the best type of beans that nature has to offer: Mochas. The Mocha coffee beans were named for the port of Mocha (Al Mokha) in Yemeni (or Yemen), where the beans were shipped from. This makes mocha, perhaps, and inaccurate name of the coffees, as it would be less confusing, and more accurate, to called them Yemen coffee beans. These beans were the now commonly referenced Arabica beans.

The original port of Mocha, today, sadly bears no resemblance to the historical site, and it mostly an uninviting ruin, long unused and replaced by the Suez canal.

It was the Ottoman Turks, who began occupying Yemen in 1536, who originally began exporting the beans through the port of Mocha, which involved a complicated trade route to Suez and then by camel to Alexandria, and then onward by French or Venetian merchants. There is, of course, a lot more to the story than this, which you can read about in [ Uncommon Grounds: The History of coffee and How it Transformed Our World]. Although the Turks tried their best to keep those Arabica beans from being planted elsewhere, the eventually began to be cultivated in various other parts. Africa, by the way, is the true birth-place of coffee.

True Mocha (or Yemen) beans are grown in the central mountains of Yemen, on the Arabian Peninsula. They are rare and quite expensive. One thing to remember about coffee is that the characteristics of any official variety of coffee have everything to do with the conditions of the specific locations in which they are grown, especially the composition of the soil. So, while there are coffees that have similar fruity and winey flavor characteristics to mocha coffee, the only true mocha comes from Yemen. It is also spelled Moka, Moca, or Mocca. There was a time when the word mocha was almost synonymous with coffee, and the term appeared often on everything to do with coffee, even if having nothing to do with Yemen coffee at all. This is much like the words coffee and café themselves, which derive from the Ethiopian Kingdom of Kaffa, often seen as the the birthplace of the coffee bean inside Ethiopia.

Some similar coffees come from Ethiopia. One is from the Harrar region of Ethiopia, which is considered to have a Mocha taste, or part of the mocha flavor family. Sometimes, the term Mocha Harrar is used for this coffee. Another Ethiopian coffee that is considered similar to mocha is Djimmah Mocha.

Second only to oil, coffee is the most valuable legally traded commodity in the world. We love it, we rely on it, and we drink it in massive quantities. It is estimated that 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed each day worldwide. New Yorkers are said to drink 7 times the amount of any other U.S. city, which is why it may seem like there is a Starbucks on every corner of Manhattan. Famed French writer and philosopher Voltaire was rumored to have drunk 40 – 50 cups per day. Coffee is a daily ritual in the lives of millions of humans around the globe. Where exactly did this caffeinated phenomenon begin?

As with most foods that have been around for centuries, coffee’s beginnings are enveloped in mystery and lore. There is a popular Ethiopian legend wherein coffee is discovered by a goat herder named Kaldi, who found his goats frolicking and full of energy after eating the red fruit of the coffee shrub. Kaldi tried the fruit for himself and had a similar reaction. After witnessing their strange behavior, a monk took some of the fruit back to his fellow monks; they too spent the night awake and alert. Of course, they would have been reacting to coffee’s high dose of caffeine. This natural stimulant also serves as an inborn plant pesticide, protecting the coffee fruit from insects.

Before coffee became our morning beverage of choice, it appeared in a variety of different preparations. In its most basic, unprocessed form, coffee is a cherry-like fruit, which becomes red when ripe; the coffee bean is found at the center of the red coffee fruit. Early on, the fruit were mixed with animal fat to create a protein rich snack bar. At one point, the fermented pulp was used to make a wine-like concoction; incidentally, a similar beverage was made from the cacao fruit, before the advent of chocolate, which goes to show that humans are especially adept at finding new ways to imbibe. Another drink that appeared around 1000 A.D. was made from the whole coffee fruit, including the beans and the hull. It wasn’t until the 13th century that people began to roast coffee beans, the first step in the process of making coffee as we know it today.

The word “coffee” has roots in several languages. In Yemen it earned the name qahwah, which was originally a romantic term for wine. It later became the Turkish kahveh, then Dutch koffie and finally coffee in English.

The modern version of roasted coffee originated in Arabia. During the 13th century, coffee was extremely popular with the Muslim community for its stimulant powers, which proved useful during long prayer sessions. By parching and boiling the coffee beans, rendering them infertile, the Arabs were able to corner the market on coffee crops. In fact, tradition says that not a single coffee plant existed outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s, when Baba Budan, an Indian pilgrim, left Mecca with fertile beans fastened to a strap across his abdomen. Baba’s beans resulted in a new and competitive European coffee trade.

In 1616, the Dutch founded the first European-owned coffee estate in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, then Java in 1696. The French began growing coffee in the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil. European coffee houses sprang up in Italy and later France, where they reached a new level of popularity. Now, it is de rigueur for Parisians to indulge in a cup of coffee and a baguette or croissant at the numerous coffee cafes throughout Paris.

Coffee plants reached the New World during the early 18th century, though the drink wasn’t really popular in America until the Boston Tea Party of 1773, when making the switch from tea to coffee became something of a patriotic duty. The Civil War and other conflicts that followed also helped to increase coffee consumption, as soldiers relied on the caffeine for a boost of energy. It may have started a bit later here, but Americans love coffee just as much as the rest of the world. Teddy Roosevelt himself is counted among America’s great coffee drinkers due to his rumored consumption of a gallon of coffee daily! Roosevelt is also said to have coined Maxwell House’s famous “Good to the Last Drop” slogan after being served the coffee at Andrew Jackson’s historical home, the Hermitage, in Tennessee.

By the late 1800s, coffee had become a worldwide commodity, and entrepreneurs began looking for new ways to profit from the popular beverage. In 1864, John and Charles Arbuckle, brothers from Pittsburgh, purchased Jabez Burns’ newly invented self-emptying coffee bean roaster. The Arbuckle brothers began selling pre-roasted coffee in paper bags by the pound. They named their coffee “Ariosa,” and found great success selling it to the cowboys of the American West. It wasn’t long before James Folger followed suit and began selling coffee to the gold miners of California. This blazed the trail for several other big name coffee producers, including Maxwell House and Hills Brothers.

In the 1960s, a certain awareness for specialty coffee started to grow, inspiring the opening of the first Starbucks in Seattle in 1971. Today, the grass-roots coffee movement continues to grow with the increase of small independently-owned cafes boasting sustainable, locally roasted, fair trade beans. Coffee has become an artistic trade that is valued for its complexity of flavors and terroir, much like wine.

From a simple cup of black coffee to a complex, multi-adjective Starbucks order, each coffee drinker has their own favorite way of indulging in this caffeinated wonder-drink. Here are six coffee-inspired recipes that will give you some new ways to enjoy this ancient beverage.
